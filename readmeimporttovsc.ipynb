    "\n",
    "Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's R) is a statistical measure used to assess the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calculating Pearson's R, we aim to determine whether there is a significant linear association between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The coefficient helps us quantify the extent to which the variables vary together and provides insight into the direction (positive or negative) and strength (magnitude) of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate Pearson's R in Python, we can use the corrcoef function from the numpy module. This function takes the two variables as input and returns the correlation matrix, where the coefficient of interest is the element in the [0, 1] or [1, 0] position. Pearson's R ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, 0 indicates no linear relationship, and 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship.\n",

    "\n",

    "### 1st Hypothesis Does Proof  Affect Wine Quality?\n",

    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): proof does not have a correlation with wine quality.\n",
