    "\n",
    "In this project we will be using the Telco Data Set. Exploring the data, we will find features that are correlated with Property Tax Assesed Values (taxvaluedollarcnt)using PearsonsR, in order to run features through a model that will predict the Property Tax Assessed Values. The goal is to beat baseline using one of the four regression models: Linear Regression(OLS), LassoLars, TweedieRegressor(GLM), and Polynomial Regression.\n",

    "\n",
    "Pearson's correlation coefficient (Pearson's R) is a statistical measure used to assess the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "By calculating Pearson's R, we aim to determine whether there is a significant linear association between the independent variable and the dependent variable. The coefficient helps us quantify the extent to which the variables vary together and provides insight into the direction (positive or negative) and strength (magnitude) of the relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate Pearson's R in Python, we can use the corrcoef function from the numpy module. This function takes the two variables as input and returns the correlation matrix, where the coefficient of interest is the element in the [0, 1] or [1, 0] position. Pearson's R ranges from -1 to 1, where -1 indicates a perfect negative linear relationship, 0 indicates no linear relationship, and 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the hypotheses for the PearsonsR test can be stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1st Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): bathroom_count does not have a correlation with tax_value.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): bathroom_count has a correlation with tax_value.\n",

    "### 2nd Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): bedroom_count does not have a correlation with tax_value.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): bedroom_count has a correlation with tax_value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3rd Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): yearbuilt does not have a correlation with tax_value.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): yearbuilt has a correlation with tax_value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4th Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): calc_sqr_ft does not have a correlation with tax_value.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H1): calc_sqr_ft has a correlation with tax_value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stats Test 1: Independent T=Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent t-test is a statistical method used to examine the association between a categorical variable and a continuous variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the independent t-test, we aim to determine whether there is a significant association between the both one categorical variable and a continuous variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5th Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H0): county_code is not associated with tax_value.\n",
